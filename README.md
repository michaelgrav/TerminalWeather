A terminal application to get the weather.

# How to run
The current way to call the program is with three arguments

# Getting an API key
This program using the openweatherAPI to get the weather data. Go to https://openweathermap.org/ and regester for an account to get an API key. When I build the project, I will include my API key in the build so you dont need to get one.
